# Current implementation to modify:
@src/components/experience-timeline.tsx
@src/types/experience.ts
@src/components/skills-section.tsx
@src/types/skills.ts

# Key decisions from prior phases:
- Phase 5: Alternating timeline layout with glass-premium cards, expandable details, gradient line, animated dots
- Phase 6: Skills grid with category filtering, proficiency indicators, icon mapping, bento layout
- Phase 11: Glassmorphism utilities, bento grid layouts, staggered animations

**Why this change:** Resume shows 4 positions across 3 companies (not just Logicwind progression). Current timeline is fictional. This corrects work history and adds real-time systems expertise (Socket.IO, WebSockets), team leadership (6-member team, technical debt reduction), and cloud infrastructure (AWS, CloudFlare).
  </action>
  <verify>
experiences array has 4 entries with correct companies (Ink In Caps x2, Blodin, Tracxn), dates match resume, titles include "Team Lead – Frontend Systems", and responsibilities mention Socket.IO, WebSockets, team leadership, CI/CD, AWS.
  </verify>
  <done>
Experience data updated with accurate 3-company history including team leadership role and real-time systems expertise.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Reorganize skills into expertise-based categories</name>
  <files>src/types/skills.ts</files>
  <action>
Replace skillCategories array with expertise-based organization:

**New category structure (4 categories instead of 8):**

1. **Real-Time Systems** (Core competency):
   - Socket.IO (5, 2 yrs)
   - WebSockets (5, 2 yrs)
   - Event-Driven UI (5, 2 yrs)
   - Next.js (5, 3 yrs)
   - React (5, 3 yrs)
   - Reconnection Strategies (4, 1 yr)

2. **Performance Engineering**:
   - Virtualization (4, 2 yrs)
   - Lazy Loading (5, 3 yrs)
   - Code Splitting (5, 3 yrs)
   - Performance Optimization (5, 3 yrs)
   - Bundle Analysis (4, 2 yrs)
   - Lighthouse Auditing (4, 2 yrs)

3. **Leadership & Architecture**:
   - Team Leadership (5, 1 yr)
   - Technical Roadmap (4, 1 yr)
   - CI/CD (5, 2 yrs)
   - Code Review (5, 3 yrs)
   - Architecture Design (4, 2 yrs)
   - Technical Debt Management (4, 1 yr)
   - Monitoring (Sentry, CloudWatch) (4, 2 yrs)

4. **Frontend Stack**:
   - TypeScript (5, 3 yrs)
   - JavaScript (5, 3 yrs)
   - HTML5/CSS3 (5, 3 yrs)
   - Tailwind CSS (5, 3 yrs)
   - State Management (Zustand, Redux, Recoil) (5, 3 yrs)
   - Build Tools (Vite, Webpack) (5, 3 yrs)
   - Testing (Jest, RTL) (4, 2 yrs)
   - Git/GitHub (5, 3 yrs)
   - AWS (EC2, Lambda, CloudFlare) (4, 1 yr)

**Remove:** Generic categories like "Soft Skills", "Tools", "Backend", "Build Tools", "Testing" - these are now integrated into Leadership & Architecture or Frontend Stack.

**Why this change:** Current 8 categories are generic and don't highlight differentiating expertise. New organization emphasizes real-time systems as core competency, performance engineering, and leadership - aligning with resume positioning as "Team Lead – Frontend Systems Engineer" who specializes in real-time, high-traffic systems.

**Icon mappings:** Add icon names for new skills (Socket.IO, WebSockets, Event-Driven UI, etc.) - use appropriate Lucide icons or simple fallbacks.
  </action>
  <verify>
skillCategories has 4 categories: "Real-Time Systems", "Performance Engineering", "Leadership & Architecture", "Frontend Stack". Each skill has appropriate proficiency (1-5) and years. Socket.IO, WebSockets, Leadership skills are present.
  </verify>
  <done>
Skills reorganized into 4 expertise-based categories emphasizing real-time systems, performance engineering, and leadership competencies.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: update skills section Category type</name>
  <files>src/types/skills.ts</files>
  <action>
Update Category type union to match new 4 categories:

```typescript
export type Category =
  | 'Real-Time Systems'
  | 'Performance Engineering'
  | 'Leadership & Architecture'
  | 'Frontend Stack';
```

**Why this change:** TypeScript type must match actual category names to prevent type errors when filtering skills by category.
  </action>
  <verify>
Category type union matches the 4 new category names exactly.
  </verify>
  <done>
Category type updated to match new expertise-based categories.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 4: Add icon mappings for new skills</name>
  <files>src/lib/icons.tsx</files>
  <action>
Add icon mappings for skills that may not exist in current mapping:

**New skills to map:**
- 'SocketIO' → Server icon
- 'WebSockets' → Network icon
- 'EventDrivenUI' → Zap icon
- 'Virtualization' → Layers icon
- 'LazyLoading' → Loader icon
- 'CodeSplitting' → Scissors icon
- 'Performance' → Gauge icon
- 'BundleAnalysis' → BarChart icon
- 'Lighthouse' → Lightbulb icon
- 'TeamLeadership' → Users icon
- 'TechnicalRoadmap' → GitBranch icon
- 'CICD' → Workflow icon
- 'Monitoring' → Activity icon
- 'CloudWatch' → Cloud icon

**Why this change:** New skills added to skillCategories need icon mappings to display correctly in skills grid. Without mappings, skills show fallback emoji instead of professional icons.

**Pattern:** Follow existing getIconComponent function pattern in icons.tsx. Use Lucide React icons for consistency.
  </action>
  <verify>
getIconComponent function returns Lucide icons for all new skill names (SocketIO, WebSockets, TeamLeadership, etc.). No console errors for missing icon mappings.
  </verify>
  <done>
Icon mappings added for all new skills including real-time systems, performance engineering, and leadership skills.
