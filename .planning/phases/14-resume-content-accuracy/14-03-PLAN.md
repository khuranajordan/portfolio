# Current implementation to modify:
@src/types/projects.ts
@src/components/projects-section.tsx

# Key decisions from prior phases:
- Phase 7: Mixed presentation formats (showcase for major projects, cards for smaller work), showcase projects get full-featured layouts
- Phase 11: Bento grid layouts for cards, glass-card utilities, enhanced styling

  <action>
Add KNKY project as first entry in projects array:

```typescript
{
  id: '0',
  title: 'KNKY - Social Networking Platform',
  shortDescription: 'Real-time social platform with live chat, matchmaking, and media sharing',
  longDescription: 'Built a full-featured social networking platform with real-time features serving thousands of concurrent users. Implemented Socket.IO-based chat system, real-time matchmaking algorithm, and shared media galleries with event-driven UI and automatic reconnection strategies.',

    'Tailwind CSS'
  ],
  features: [
    'Real-time chat with Socket.IO and event-driven UI',
    'Live matchmaking system with WebSocket connections',
    'Shared media galleries with real-time updates',
    'Automatic reconnection strategies for unstable connections',
    'Optimistic UI updates for instant feedback',
    'User presence indicators and typing indicators',
    'Push notifications for new messages and matches'
  ],
  achievements: [
    'Serving 1000s of concurrent users with sub-100ms message latency',
    'Reduced reconnection time by 60% through connection pooling',
    'Achieved 99.9% uptime for real-time features',
    'Scaled to 10,000+ daily active users'
  ],
  challenges: [
    'Implemented heartbeat mechanism to detect stale connections',
    'Used Socket.IO rooms to efficiently broadcast to user groups',
    'Optimized bundle size by 40% through code splitting for real-time features',
    'Built custom reconnection logic with exponential backoff',
    'Integrated CloudFlare R2 for media storage with CDN delivery'
  ]
}
```

**Then renumber existing projects:** Change current E-commerce (id: '1') to id: '2', Task Management (id: '2') to id: '3', etc.

**Why this change:** Resume highlights KNKY as flagship project demonstrating real-time systems expertise. Current projects lack real-time focus. Adding KNKY showcases Socket.IO, WebSockets, event-driven UI, and high-concurrency architecture - differentiating from generic frontend portfolios.

  <name>Task 3: Add project category for Real-Time Systems</name>
  <files>src/types/projects.ts</files>

Update Project interface category type to include "Real-Time Systems":

**Add to category union (if strict typed):**
```typescript
category: 'E-Commerce' | 'Task Management' | 'Real-Time Systems' | 'Weather' | 'Expense Tracker' | 'Blog';
```

**Or use string type if already loose:**
```typescript
category: string;
