<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update education with Masai School and B.Tech details</name>
  <files>src/components/about-section.tsx</files>
  <action>
Replace education array (lines 8-17) with accurate education history:

```typescript
const education = [
  {
    degree: "Full Stack Development",
    field: "Professional Training",
    institution: "Masai School",
    location: "Remote",
    year: "2022 - 2023",
    gpa: "Intensive Bootcamp"
  },
  {
    degree: "B.Tech in Computer Science",
    field: "Computer Science & Engineering",
    institution: "Bundelkhand Institute of Engineering & Technology",
    location: "Jhansi, India",
    year: "2018 - 2022",
    gpa: "Bachelor's Degree"
  }
];
```

**Why this change:** Current education shows fictional "Bachelor of Computer Applications from Gujarat University". Resume shows actual education is Masai School bootcamp (2022-2023) + B.Tech from Bundelkhand Institute (2018-2022). This corrects credentials to match reality.

**Also update career summary section** (lines 19-47) to reflect real-time focus:
- Change "Currently working as Senior Frontend Developer at Logicwind" to "Currently Team Lead – Frontend Systems at Ink In Caps"
- Change "Specialized in React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies" to "Specializing in real-time systems, Socket.IO, and high-traffic architecture"
  </action>
  <verify>
education array has 2 entries: Masai School (2022-2023, Full Stack Development) and Bundelkhand Institute (2018-2022, B.Tech). Career summary text mentions "Team Lead – Frontend Systems" and "real-time systems, Socket.IO".
  </verify>
  <done>
Education updated with accurate Masai School and B.Tech credentials, and career summary revised to emphasize leadership and real-time systems.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Rewrite professional introduction narrative</name>
  <files>src/components/about-section.tsx</files>
  <action>
Replace introduction text in left column card (lines 78-89) with narrative emphasizing team leadership and real-time systems:

```tsx
<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Hi, I'm Rohan 👋</h3>
<p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4 leading-relaxed">
  I'm a Team Lead – Frontend Systems Engineer with a passion for building real-time systems at scale. I lead teams architecting high-traffic applications with Socket.IO, WebSockets, and modern frontend infrastructure. Currently serving thousands of concurrent users with sub-100ms latency.
</p>
<p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4 leading-relaxed">
  My journey started with intensive training at Masai School, followed by rapid progression from Software Engineer to Team Lead across three companies. I specialize in real-time architecture, performance engineering, and building reliable frontend systems that scale.
</p>
<p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
  I'm passionate about engineering leadership, technical debt reduction, and mentoring teams to deliver exceptional user experiences. When I'm not architecting real-time features or optimizing performance, I'm contributing to open source and sharing knowledge with the developer community.
</p>
```

**Why this change:** Current introduction ("Senior Frontend Developer with passion for beautiful, functional experiences") is generic and doesn't emphasize differentiating expertise. New narrative positions as "Team Lead – Frontend Systems Engineer" with real-time systems specialization, leadership experience, and technical ownership - aligning with resume and hero section.
  </action>
  <verify>
Introduction mentions "Team Lead – Frontend Systems Engineer", "real-time systems", "Socket.IO", "WebSockets", "high-traffic applications", "technical debt reduction", "mentoring teams".
  </verify>
  <done>
Professional introduction rewritten to emphasize team leadership, real-time systems expertise, and engineering focus.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update professional journey component with accurate milestones</name>
  <files>src/components/professional-journey.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update professional journey milestones to match actual career progression:

**Replace hardcoded journey data with accurate timeline:**

```typescript
const milestones = [
  {
    year: '2025',
    title: 'Team Lead – Frontend Systems',
    company: 'Ink In Caps',
    description: 'Leading 6-member team, architecting real-time features, reducing technical debt by 30%'
  },
  {
    year: '2024',
    title: 'Senior Software Engineer',
    company: 'Ink In Caps',
    description: 'Built KNKY real-time social platform, served 1000s of concurrent users with Socket.IO'
  },
  {
    year: '2023',
    title: 'Software Engineer',
    company: 'Blodin Pvt. Ltd.',
    description: 'Developed React applications with state management and performance optimization'
  },
  {
    year: '2022',
    title: 'Frontend Development',
    company: 'Masai School',
    description: 'Intensive full-stack training with React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies'
  }
];
```

**Why this change:** Professional journey should match accurate resume progression (Masai School → Blodin → Ink In Caps Senior → Ink In Caps Team Lead). Current journey likely shows fictional progression. This ensures consistency with experience timeline and reinforces real narrative.

**Also update component styling** if needed to match glass-card utilities from Phase 11.
  </action>
  <verify>
professional-journey.tsx shows 4 milestones: Team Lead 2025, Senior SE 2024, Software Engineer 2023, Frontend Development 2022 at Masai. Companies match experience timeline (Ink In Caps, Blodin, Masai).
  </verify>
  <done>
Professional journey updated with accurate milestones matching resume progression and emphasizing leadership and real-time systems.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 4: Update location and flexibility information</name>
  <files>src/components/about-section.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update location card in career summary (lines 38-47):

**Change from:**
```typescript
{
  icon: MapPin,
  title: "Location",
  items: [
    "Based in Gujarat, India",
    "Open to remote opportunities worldwide",
    "Flexible with relocation for the right opportunity"
  ]
}
```

**To match resume (if location differs):**
Update location if resume shows different city/state. If Gujarat is correct, keep as-is.

**Why this change:** Ensure location information matches resume. If resume shows different location, correct it here for consistency.
  </action>
  <verify>
Location card shows accurate location matching resume (Gujarat or corrected if different).
  </verify>
  <done>
Location information verified and updated to match resume.
