# Current implementation to modify:
@src/components/hero.tsx

# Key decisions from prior phases:
- Phase 4: Hero layout with floating feature cards (Experience, Tech Stack), animated gradient background, staggered text entrance animations
- Phase 11: Apple-inspired typography with text-display and text-hero scales, glass-card utility, premium aesthetic
- Phase 12: Vibrant color gradients with smooth transitions, animated background layers

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update hero title to Team Lead – Frontend Systems Engineer</name>
  <files>src/components/hero.tsx</files>
  <action>
Replace current title "Senior Frontend Developer" (lines 81-106) with accurate title:

**Title structure (text-hero scale):**
- Line 1: "Team Lead"
- Line 2: "Frontend"
- Line 3: "Systems Engineer"

**Animation:** Keep existing staggered text entrance (0s, 0.1s, 0.2s delays) with text-hero font scale and primary color.

**Why this change:** Resume shows actual title is "Team Lead – Frontend Systems Engineer" not generic "Senior Frontend Developer". This accurately reflects leadership role and systems engineering focus.
  </action>
  <verify>
Hero section displays three-line title "Team Lead / Frontend / Systems Engineer" with proper staggered animation, text-hero typography scale, and primary color gradient.
  </verify>
  <done>
Title updated to "Team Lead / Frontend / Systems Engineer" with existing animation and styling preserved.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Rewrite value proposition for real-time systems and leadership focus</name>
  <files>src/components/hero.tsx</files>
  <action>
Replace current value proposition (lines 110-119) with accurate positioning:

**New copy:**
```
I build real-time systems at scale, leading frontend architecture and teams to deliver
high-performance applications. Expert in Socket.IO, WebSocket architecture, and
engineering practices that serve thousands of concurrent users.
```

**Why this change:** Current copy ("I build exceptional digital experiences with React, TypeScript") is generic and doesn't reflect actual expertise in real-time systems, team leadership, or performance engineering. New copy aligns with resume's emphasis on real-time, high-traffic systems.
  </action>
  <verify>
Value proposition text mentions: real-time systems, Socket.IO, WebSocket architecture, team leadership, high-traffic/performance scale.
  </verify>
  <done>
Hero value proposition rewritten to emphasize real-time systems expertise and team leadership experience.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update floating info cards with accurate expertise</name>
  <files>src/components/hero.tsx</files>
  <action>
Replace both floating cards (lines 169-228) with accurate expertise cards:

**Left card - Real-Time Systems (replace "Experience"):**
- Icon: Keep Sparkles or change to Zap/Activity icon for real-time feel
- Title: "Real-Time Systems"
- Subtitle: "Socket.IO • WebSockets • High-Traffic"
- Description: "Serving 1000s of concurrent users"

**Right card - Team Leadership (replace "Tech Stack"):**
- Icon: Users or GitBranch for leadership
- Title: "Team Lead + Architect"
- Subtitle: "6-Member Team • CI/CD • Reliability"
- Description: "Reduced technical debt by 30%"

**Why this change:** Current cards ("3+ Years Experience - Senior Frontend Developer" and "React + TypeScript - Modern Tech Stack") are generic and don't highlight differentiating expertise. New cards showcase real-time systems specialization and leadership achievements from resume.

**Styling:** Keep glass-card, rounded-2xl, animated border-color cycling (4s duration), responsive hiding (md:block for left, lg:block for right).
  </action>
  <verify>
Left card shows "Real-Time Systems" with Socket.IO/WebSockets/high-traffic mention. Right card shows "Team Lead + Architect" with 6-member team and 30% technical debt reduction. Both cards maintain existing glass-card styling and animations.

  <done>
Floating cards updated to showcase real-time systems expertise and team leadership achievements with accurate metrics from resume.
