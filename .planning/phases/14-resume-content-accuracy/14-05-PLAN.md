  <name>Task 1: Cross-verify title and role consistency across all sections</name>
  <files>src/components/hero.tsx, src/types/experience.ts, src/components/about-section.tsx</files>
  <action>
Verify consistent title/role across sections:

**Check that:**
1. Hero section title: "Team Lead – Frontend Systems Engineer" (3 lines: "Team Lead / Frontend / Systems Engineer")
2. Experience timeline first entry: "Team Lead – Frontend Systems" at Ink In Caps
3. About section introduction: Mentions "Team Lead – Frontend Systems Engineer"
4. About section career summary: Mentions "Team Lead – Frontend Systems" at Ink In Caps
5. Professional journey: First milestone is "Team Lead – Frontend Systems" in 2025

**Fix any inconsistencies:**
- If any section still says "Senior Frontend Developer" → Update to "Team Lead – Frontend Systems Engineer"
- If company names differ → Standardize on "Ink In Caps" (not "Logicwind")
- If dates don't match → Align to Jul 2025 start for Team Lead role

**Why this verification:** Portfolio must tell consistent story. If hero says "Team Lead" but experience says "Senior Frontend Developer", recruiters will notice inconsistencies. All sections must align.
  </action>
  <verify>
Hero, experience, about, and professional journey all use "Team Lead – Frontend Systems Engineer" or "Team Lead – Frontend Systems". No mention of "Senior Frontend Developer" or "Logicwind". All Team Lead dates show Jul 2025 or present.
  </verify>
  <done>
Title and role information consistent across all sections with standardized "Team Lead – Frontend Systems Engineer" phrasing.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify real-time systems expertise is prominent throughout</name>
  <files>src/components/hero.tsx, src/types/skills.ts, src/types/projects.ts, src/components/about-section.tsx</files>
  <action>
Verify real-time systems emphasis across sections:

**Hero section:**
- Value prop mentions "real-time systems", "Socket.IO", "WebSocket architecture"
- Left floating card: "Real-Time Systems" with "Socket.IO • WebSockets • High-Traffic"

**Skills section:**
- First category tab: "Real-Time Systems" (not "Frontend")
- Skills include: Socket.IO (5 proficiency), WebSockets (5), Event-Driven UI (5)
- Other categories: Performance Engineering, Leadership & Architecture, Frontend Stack

**Projects section:**
- First showcase project: KNKY with "Socket.IO" and "WebSockets" in tech stack
- KNKY features include: "Real-time chat", "Live matchmaking", "Event-driven UI"
- KNKY stats show: "1000s of Concurrent Users", "<100ms Message Latency"

**About section:**
- Introduction mentions: "real-time systems at scale", "Socket.IO, WebSockets"
- Career summary mentions: "Specializing in real-time systems, Socket.IO"
- Professional journey mentions: "Built KNKY real-time social platform"

**Fix if missing:**
- If hero doesn't mention real-time → Add to value prop or floating cards
- If skills don't have Real-Time Systems category → Reorganize to prioritize
- If KNKY not first project → Reorder to showcase real-time work first
- If about section doesn't mention Socket.IO → Add to introduction

**Why this verification:** Resume positioning is "Team Lead – Frontend Systems Engineer" who specializes in real-time systems. This expertise should be prominent across ALL sections to differentiate from generic frontend devs.
  </action>
  <verify>
Every section (hero, skills, projects, about) mentions real-time systems, Socket.IO, or WebSockets. Real-Time Systems is first skills category. KNKY is first showcase project.
  </verify>
  <done>
Real-time systems expertise consistently prominent across all portfolio sections.

  <name>Task 3: Verify company names and dates match across sections</name>
  <files>src/types/experience.ts, src/components/about-section.tsx, src/components/professional-journey.tsx</files>
  <action>
Verify company consistency:

**Experience timeline:**
1. Ink In Caps - Team Lead (Jul 2025–Present)
2. Ink In Caps - Senior SE (Mar 2024–Jul 2025)
3. Blodin Pvt. Ltd. - SE (Jul 2023–Feb 2024)
4. Tracxn Technologies - SE (Jan 2023–Apr 2023)

**About section education:**
- Masai School (2022-2023)
- Bundelkhand Institute (2018-2022)

**Professional journey:**
- 2025: Team Lead at Ink In Caps
- 2024: Senior SE at Ink In Caps
- 2023: SE at Blodin
- 2022: Frontend Development at Masai School

**Fix inconsistencies:**
- Remove any "Logicwind" references (wrong company)
- Ensure "Ink In Caps" is spelled correctly
- Verify dates align (no gaps, no overlaps)
- Ensure Traczn dates (Jan-Apr 2023) are included

**Why this verification:** Company names and dates must be accurate. Recruiter background checks will verify employment history. Fictional companies or wrong dates immediately disqualify candidates.
  </action>
  <verify>
All sections use "Ink In Caps", "Blodin Pvt. Ltd.", "Tracxn Technologies". No "Logicwind" references. Dates align chronologically: Masai 2022-2023 → Traczn Jan-Apr 2023 → Blodin Jul 2023-Feb 2024 → Ink In_caps Mar 2024-Jul 2025 → Ink In_caps Jul 2025-Present.

  <name>Task 4: Check for remaining generic content that should be specific</name>
  <files>src/components/hero.tsx, src/components/about-section.tsx, src/components/skills-section.tsx</files>
  <action>
Scan for generic placeholders that should be specific:

**Hero section:**
- Right card: Should NOT be "React + TypeScript - Modern Tech Stack" (too generic)
- Should be: "Team Lead + Architect - 6-Member Team • CI/CD • Reliability" (specific)

**About section:**
- Introduction should NOT say "passionate about creating beautiful, functional experiences" (generic)
- Should say: "passionate about building real-time systems at scale" (specific)

**Skills section:**
- Should NOT have "Soft Skills" category (too generic)
- Should have "Leadership & Architecture" with specific skills (Team Leadership, Technical Roadmap, CI/CD)

**Projects section:**
- Should NOT have generic "Weather App" or "Expense Tracker" as top projects
- KNKY should be first showcase project (real-time expertise)

**Fix if found:**
- Replace generic text with specific expertise
- Reorder projects to prioritize real-time work
- Remove or fold generic categories into specific ones

**Why this verification:** Portfolio should scream "Team Lead – Frontend Systems Engineer with real-time expertise" not "generic frontend dev". Every section should reinforce specific positioning.
  </action>
  <verify>
No generic "Modern Tech Stack" cards. No "beautiful, functional experiences" copy. Skills categories are expertise-based (Real-Time Systems, Performance Engineering, Leadership & Architecture, Frontend Stack). KNKY is first project.

All generic content replaced with specific, positioning-reinforcing content.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 5: Verify TypeScript compilation and build success</name>
  <files>src/types/*.ts, src/components/*.tsx</files>
  <action>
Run build to verify no TypeScript errors:

```bash
npm run build
```

**Check for:**
- Type errors in skills.ts (Category type mismatch)
- Type errors in projects.ts (category not in union)
- Type errors in experience.ts (missing fields)
- Import errors in components (wrong paths)

**Fix any errors:**
- If Category type error → Update type union to match all categories
- If project category error → Add "Real-Time Systems" to union or use `string` type
- If missing fields → Add required fields to interfaces
- If import errors → Fix import paths

**Why this verification:** TypeScript errors prevent build and suggest data structure inconsistencies. All types must match actual data.
  </action>
  <verify>
npm run build completes successfully with no TypeScript errors. No console errors about missing types, wrong categories, or invalid imports.
  </verify>
  <done>
TypeScript compilation successful with zero errors.
