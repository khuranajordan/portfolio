**What was attempted**:
- Gradient-lettermark design (selected from 4 options)
- Typographic RK monogram with theme colors
- Inline SVG for proper color inheritance
- Favicon generation pipeline with sharp

**Outcome**:
- Logo designs did not complement the portfolio's modern, colorful aesthetic
- User feedback: "colors don't match the website theme at all"

**Plans**: 1 plan (attempted, incomplete)

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 13 to break down)

**Details:**
Current branding uses generic text-based representation. This phase will create a distinctive, professional logo that represents Rohan Khurana's frontend engineering expertise. Focus on:
- Unique, memorable visual identity
- Modern, clean aesthetic
- Versatile across all touchpoints (favicon, header, print, social)
- Scalable from small (favicon 16x16) to large (presentations)
- Consistent with colorful theme from Phase 12
