## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

**From Phase 1:**
- Used Vite for fast HMR and build times
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- Tailwind CSS v4 for utility-first styling
- shadcn/ui New York style for modern aesthetic
- Slate neutral palette for professional appearance

**From Phase 2:**
- next-themes for theme state management (proven library)
- Class-based dark mode (matches Tailwind config)
- System preference as default (respects user OS settings)
- Dropdown menu for explicit theme control
- Instant theme changes (universal transitions caused blinking)

**From Phase 3:**
- Sticky header with backdrop blur (modern, stays accessible)
- Sheet component for mobile menu (smooth UX, slides from right)
- Smooth scroll behavior with scrollIntoView API
- navItems array pattern (DRY code, shared between desktop/mobile)
- Responsive breakpoints using hidden/md:flex utilities
